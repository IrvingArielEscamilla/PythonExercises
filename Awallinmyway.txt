A WALL IN MY WAY

I thought that I was free but it is not true
A wall stands in my way to freedom. Bricks, stones…
Masonry patterns… Maybe so are the trees and rivers
Columbs and dams: walls of obstacles
Barries, impediments, burlesque fortresses
As a landscape winter fills my view with snow
The silent wind forms a wall in front my eyes!
And then nothingness, death´s song is constant
Time singing of death… A wall stands, no news
No writing of graffiti… The flat, horizontal flame
My heart is broken. My feet are without shoes
And my hands are without flesh
There is no food so that I can´t dream
The wall has no doors to escape through
Can I cross the insipid matter?
I am alone and free but still the wall stands in my way
And
Is anybody there, hearing me on the other side of my wall?
